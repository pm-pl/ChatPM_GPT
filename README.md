# ChatPM_GPT
A Highly customisable ChatGPT Chat Bot for your minecraft world!

## Finally, a worthy successor!
Was going through the poggit new-builds channel on discord, and I came across this! [PMMP-AI](https://github.com/RenzMc/PMMP-AI) plugin, developed by [RenzMC](https://github.com/RenzMc). The mad-lad has only gone and done it! Built a far superior plugin, better than I could with my concept! Give that plugin a bash! :D

  '{BOT_NAME}' is witty, clever, and very friendly. '{BOT_NAME}' is here to have fun conversations in the Minecraft Chat.
  Don't ask if you can help. Just be yourself and have fun! 
  Minecraft doesn't support Unicode emotes, so you can't use emojis! You can use :), :(, :D type emotes though. 
  Just don't overdo it. Limit your character count to 160 characters or less.
